2. Operating Instructions 
*************************************************************************

!	Macros must be enabled for full functionality.
1.	This spreadsheet is intended to provide a list of what has been checked (and what has not been checked) during a customer schematic review. It is not intended to be a comprehensive checklist.
	
2.	The Project Info page gives an overview of the schematic that is being reviewed, and the person(s) performing the review. It also contains the Purpose and Disclaimer paragraphs.
	
3.	The Checklist pages contain some of the more common items that should be checked. In some cases, these items might not apply to a specific schematic review, and can be ignored. In other cases, there might be additional items that need to be checked. In that case, the user can add a line to the end of the worksheet.
	
4.	The Checklist pages are intended to collect information for a single FPGA/MPSoC and its supporting device (such as configuration memory). At the top of the Checklist page, the device part number and reference designator need to be recorded. If there are multiple devices, a workbook should be created for each device.
	
5.	"Each cell in the Status column has a pull-down menu with the color-coded selections OK, CHECK, and PROBLEM. The Status column allows the customer to quickly see the results of the schematic review.
· OK: The item receives reviewer approval.
· CHECK: The reviewer does not have sufficient information to determine if the item is OK or poses a PROBLEM. The designer must research the item and provide additional information.
· PROBLEM: There is an issue with the item. PROBLEM flags the item for the designer, who needs to research the issue and find a solution.
· Not Checked: The item has not been checked and might require additional attention.
· N/A: The item is not applicable to this device or design."
	
6.	The Actual Implementation column can be used to provide additional clarification. This information is especially important if the item is tagged with CHECK or PROBLEM.
